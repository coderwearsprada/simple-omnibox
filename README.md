# simple-omnibox
A simple boilerplate for new omnibox development for chrome extension.

When I started learning how to write a chrom extension, I wanted to code something that reads my address bar input and does a backend API call when Enter is hit. I failed to find the simplest omnibox chrome extension example that actually works. 

This extension is written with triggering keyword set to "omni". You can choose to change the keyword to your taste.

So here you go. Your simple omnibox chrome extension. You can edit the content to put in your javascript. Comments/feedbacks welcomed at coderwearsprada@gmail.com
